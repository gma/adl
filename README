Installation
============

Copy adl and then ask it to install itself:

  $ sudo sh ./adl -C Installing adl
  $ sudo sh ./adl -e /usr/local/bin/adl

The second command will open your editor. Load the contents of the adl script
into the empty file, save it, and quit your editor.

Finally, make adl executable:

  $ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/adl
